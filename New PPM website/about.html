        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>When the global pandemic hit I knew I had to step up and contribute however I could. Remembering my school day sewing classes from decades before I realised I could start to create face masks ‚Äì contributing to society in my own way.</p>
        <p>From these humble beginnings at SewJackie what stood out more than others was the ability to personalise the textiles to bespoke needs. Seeing this in action, revolutionary brain scanning innovators approached me to address the final part of the jigsaw of their ground-breaking design.</p>
        <p>It was at this point that the potential to contribute to a wider audience became apparent.</p>
        <p><strong>Advance Textile Solutions was created.</strong></p>
        <p>Now moving forwards, the Advance Textile Solutions repertoire has extended into human healthcare, wellbeing and equestrian care we don‚Äôt stop there. We‚Äôve realised that bespoke fabric design can be the solution ‚Äì whatever the textile problem we‚Äôre ready to collaborate with you to find the answer.</p>
